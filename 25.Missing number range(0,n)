There are N students in a classroom , The students which are present are in the array present [] , one student absent for the class
Find and return the number of that student who is absent .

Example 1:
Input: present = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: N = 3 since there are 3 students, so all numbers are in the range [0,3].
2 is the absent student in the range since it does not appear in present.

Example 2:
Input: present = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: N = 2 since there are 2 students, so all numbers are in the range [0,2].
2 is the absent student in the range since it does not appear in present.
